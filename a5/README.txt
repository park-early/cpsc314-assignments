BRIEF ASSIGNMENT SELF-ASSESSMENT:
  e.g.,  I learned x, y, and z.  I struggled with a, b, and c.

I learned how to use a skybox and manipulate equations to have an object reflect the environment mapping.
I also got a lot more practice familiariing myself with the fragment shader.
I would say the most challenging part was trying to figure out the equation to create the gird of holes in the torus.
