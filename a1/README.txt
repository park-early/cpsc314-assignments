CREATIVE COMPONENT

(1) GENERAL COMMENTS

It's *supposed* to be the infamous barge that washed up on Stanely Park about a year ago.
But instead of being dismantled, this barge lives in an alternate world where it was set free to return to its family...

A story in 3 parts:

The torus knot was the only way I could think of making a sun. Just don't look at it from the side ;)


(2) A FEW THINGS I LEARNED WHILE WORKING ON THE CREATIVE COMPONENT

- Making complex shapes is hard, but using simpler shapes is easier. In my mind the barge was just a couple rectangles with ridges along the edge. 
But I struggled to find a way to manipulate the geometries in the way I wanted to - and I realized that building
the ridges using simple rectangles rather than trying to morph the larger rectangle would not make me go insane.

Also trying to figure out how to build a trapezoid took a REALLY long time... I don't think I would have
intuitively thought a CYLINDER could be made into a TRAPEZOID.

What I can envision =/= What I can make.

- three.js documentation is very helpful. Because the docs have pre-rendered versions of the geometries and meshes, I found that
it was easier to just adjust the sliders until I found a set of options that I liked, rather than doing trial and error
with the code.

- Animation is pretty intuitive! It didn't take long at all to understand how the update() function was working and I can already
see how the body can be manipulated to animate the objects in the scene with ease.
