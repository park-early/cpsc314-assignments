My handmade cat drawing:

Implemented features and keybindings:


J -> loop jumping. Cat will begin jumping animation on next animation loop 
        (it will finsih it's current walk cycle first before jumping)
K -> loop walking. Cat will begin walking animation on next animation loop 
        (it will finsih it's current jump cycle first before walking)

In jumping mode, watch the cat masterfully jump over the mystery block - because... well... you know... curiosity killed the cat.
